# CourseScheduler

A simple python GUI app to help Carleton University students build a timetable that doesn't suck. You can set filters to search for a timetable that doesn't have courses on a certain day(s), or doesn't have classes before/after a certain time, or my favorite - find the timetable with the least amount of time in between classes. The last filter was the reason I built this tool. I feel so much less productive during the day when you have an hour gap between each of your classes.
